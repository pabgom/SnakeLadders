# SnakeLadders

Is a very simple application.
The project is a little game of Snake and Ladders.

## Setup & Run
To run the application the only thing you need to do is execute the application and indicate the number of players.

The actual setup is running all the turns until one of the players win but there is an option if you uncomment the line 28 to stop in each turn.
